<h1>Numerical PDEs</h1>
The purpose of this project is to use Python to implement methods for numerically solving PDEs which govern physical problems.

The equations of interest are:
* Laplace's equation
* The heat equation
* The wave equation (not yet implemented)
* The Navier-Stokes equation (not yet implemented).

The methods used are:
* Finite difference method
* Euler's method
* Finite volume method (not implemented yet).
