<h1>Numerical PDEs</h1>
The purpose of this project is to use Python to implement common methods for numerically solving PDEs.

Equations of interest:
* Laplace's equation
* The heat equation
* The wave equation
* The Navier-Stokes equation (not yet implemented).

Methods:
* Finite difference method
* Euler's method
* Finite volume method (not implemented yet).
